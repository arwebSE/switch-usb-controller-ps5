## 🔬 Developer Hardware Testing Disclosure

OmniPad PS5 is developed and maintained by a solo developer. 
- **Currently on the developer's physical test bench:** **Machenike G5 Pro Max SE** (tested with both its 2.4GHz USB Dongle and direct USB-C cable).
- **Not yet physically tested on bench:** Xbox Series X\|S, Xbox One, Xbox 360, DualShock 4, DualShock 3, Switch Pro.
- **How support was built:** Decoders and handshakes were engineered from official USB HID/XInput/GIP documentation, open-source references, and verified via automated test suites (`tests/test_parsers.c`).
- **Community Call for Help:** Because the developer is actively working to acquire real Xbox and PS4 controllers for physical verification, these profiles are currently classified as **EXPERIMENTAL**. If you test with physical hardware, your feedback, bug reports, and logs are deeply valued!

## 🔍 2. Deep Dive: Microsoft Xbox Controllers (Honest Reality Check)

Because Xbox controllers are among the most popular third-party controllers in the community, here is an unambiguous, honest explanation of what works, what does not work, and why:

### ❌ What Does NOT Work in v1.0.4:
1. **Direct Wireless Bluetooth to the PS5:**
   - Modern Xbox One (Model 1708) and Xbox Series X\|S (Model 1914) controllers transmit over **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** using Microsoft's implementation of the **Security Manager Protocol (SMP)** with AES-128 cryptographic pairing.
   - OmniPad v1.0.4 does **not** enable direct console Bluetooth communication yet. **Putting your Xbox controller into Bluetooth pairing mode and expecting the PS5 to find it without an adapter will NOT work.** This subsystem is in active development for **v1.1.0**.
2. **Official "Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows" (Microsoft USB Dongle):**
   - The official Microsoft wireless dongle uses a proprietary 2.4GHz Wi-Fi Direct radio protocol requiring complex kernel drivers (such as `xone` / `mt7612u` on Linux).
   - This dongle is **NOT supported** by OmniPad or FreeBSD/ProsperoOS.

### ✅ What DOES Work in v1.0.4:
1. **Direct Wired USB-C / Micro-USB Cable:**
   - Plug the controller directly into any PS5 USB port using a **data-capable** USB cable.
   - The engine claims the GIP endpoints (`0x82` IN, `0x02` OUT), issues the initialization sequence (`0x05 0x20 0x00 0x01 0x00`), and begins decoding standard `0x20` input packets.
   - *Requirement:* The cable **must** have physical data lines. Charging-only cables (frequently shipped with cheap power banks or battery packs) will only power the LED and will not transmit input packets.
2. **Wireless via 8BitDo Wireless USB Adapter 2:**
   - Plug the 8BitDo Wireless USB Adapter 2 into the PS5.
   - Pair your Xbox controller directly to the 8BitDo adapter by holding the pairing button on both devices.
   - The 8BitDo adapter acts as an active hardware bridge, translating Xbox inputs into USB signals that OmniPad recognizes instantly.

## 📡 3. Direct Internal Bluetooth (Roadmap for v1.1.0)

Direct pairing to the PS5 motherboard's internal Bluetooth radio (`bt_hci_usb.c` / `bt_host.c`) without requiring any USB dongle or cable is under active development for **v1.1.0**:

| Controller | Protocol / Stack Requirement | Roadmap Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Sony DualShock 4** | Classic Bluetooth L2CAP (HID PSM `0x0011` / `0x0013`) | 🔄 In Development (v1.1.0) |
| **Sony DualSense / Edge** | Classic Bluetooth L2CAP (DualSense report `0x31`) | 🔄 In Development (v1.1.0) |
| **Nintendo Switch Pro** | Classic Bluetooth HID (SPI calibration & timers) | 🔄 In Development (v1.1.0) |
| **Xbox Wireless (One S / Series X\|S)** | BLE + SMP AES-128 Cryptographic Key Exchange | 🔄 In Development (v1.1.0) |
| **8BitDo Bluetooth (SN30 Pro, Pro 2)** | Standard Bluetooth HID profile | 🔄 In Development (v1.1.0) |
| **Generic Bluetooth Gamepads** | Standard Bluetooth HID | 🔄 In Development (v1.1.0) |

> 💡 **Why was Bluetooth deferred to v1.1.0?**
> The PS5's internal Bluetooth chip is also used by the operating system for system stability and sleep modes. Rushing direct HCI hijacking risked controller desyncs and console sleep panics. The team prioritized delivering a 100% rock-solid 250Hz USB Hotplug engine and the FW 13.60 profile bypass first.

## 👥 4. Multi-Player Architecture (Up to 4 Players)

OmniPad creates and manages **3 independent virtual DualSense slots** in the ProsperoOS kernel (`libScePad`):

| Player | Controller Hardware | Managed By |
|---|---|---|
| **Player 1** | Official Physical DualSense | Native PS5 Operating System |
| **Player 2** | Supported USB Controller / Dongle (Slot 1) | OmniPad PS5 Virtual Device Pool |
| **Player 3** | Supported USB Controller / Dongle (Slot 2) | OmniPad PS5 Virtual Device Pool |
| **Player 4** | Supported USB Controller / Dongle (Slot 3) | OmniPad PS5 Virtual Device Pool |

**Example 4-Player Local Setup:**
- **Player 1:** Official DualSense (Primary User)
- **Player 2:** Machenike G5 Pro (via bundled 2.4G USB Dongle)
- **Player 3:** Xbox Series X controller (connected via wired USB-C cable or 8BitDo Adapter)
- **Player 4:** Nintendo Switch Pro controller (connected via wired USB-C cable)

| **Touchpad Click** | ✅ Fully Supported | Mapped to open maps and in-game menu functions. |
| **Multi-touch Touchpad Surface** | ❌ Not Supported | Non-Sony controllers lack a capacitive touch surface. |
| **Adaptive Triggers (Motor Force)** | ❌ Not Supported | Non-DualSense controllers do not have internal resistance motors. |
| **Advanced DualSense Haptics** | ❌ Not Supported | Standard rumble is passed through where hardware permits. |
| **Gyroscope / Accelerometer (IMU)** | ❌ Neutral Only | Fixed to identity quaternion in v1.0.4. (Roadmap for motion-capable controllers). |
